# Blog-Api-Admin
Code-Blog-Admin is a tool designed to manage the content of your blog. With a user-friendly interface, you can easily create, edit, and delete articles, manage tags, and moderate comments, of your blog. The tool is built with React and TypeScript and is powered by a self-coded RESTful blog API written in Express.

# API
The CMS fetches data from a self-coded RESTful blog API. The source code for the API can be found at https://github.com/Zaid0412/Blog-Api-Backend.

# Client
The source code for the blog-client frontend can be found at https://github.com/Zaid0412/Blog-Api-Frontend.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
